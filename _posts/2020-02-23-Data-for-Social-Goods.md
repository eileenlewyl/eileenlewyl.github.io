Imagine an entire network of personalized food supply mapped using a dynamic network analysis. Each household and their needs are mapped and optimized using data. Such optimization solution can not only provide to the needy in the society but primarily also can reduce food wastage, a painful process faced by any nation from third world to first world.

Uncle A, age, family members, medical condition and history, dietary profiling, location, etc....

All of those information can be mapped out in order for NGO or charity to better understand and work out solutions to address their needs rather than oversupplying to some while underserving others. The first hurdle is to know how to obtain such information, especially sensitive information in accordance to personal data protection act. 

To work out how feasible is this, first thing is to search on database with such information. The best platform to search for them is indeed Kaggle.com.

Firstly, there is the OpenFood source ([source] https://www.kaggle.com/openfoodfacts/world-food-facts), a non-profit volunteer-run organization that has gathered database of food products from around the world, with ingredients, allergens, nutrition facts and all the tidbits of information we can find on product labels. While the open food database is focused mainly on the food content and nutrients, the second set of data we need would be on the demographics and health.

The aim to achieve at the end of the day is appropriate and optimized food distribution to the needy. The system must be able to track the flow of these distribution in a seamless and automated way, without depending on manual manipulation. Charity food management, besides raising the awareness of public on the importance of giving personalized nutrition food and diet profiling. When there is a better understanding of the people in need, we will be able to manage food among all the charity organizations without any conflicting contributions.
